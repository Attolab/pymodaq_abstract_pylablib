PyMoDAQ generic plugins meant to be subclassed for quick implementation using the pylablib library. Currently only cameras are handled.
List of cameras that can be interfaced using this class: `pylablib documentation <https://pylablib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices/cameras_root.html>`_

**Important:** this is for development purposes only, the plugin will not work on its own.

Instruments
===========

Below is the list of instruments included in this plugin

Viewer2D
++++++++

* **GenericPylablibCamera**: Generic plugin for a camera, handling hardware ROI, hardware binning, grabbing frames using a callback, switching between 1D and 2D depending on data shape, and optional framerate display.
The class needs to be subclassed in order to define the list ``list_cameras`` and the method ``init_controller``, which depend on the actual camera.
